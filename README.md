# Overview

This repository contains all data required to reproduce the results in our paper. It also contains detailed information about the systems we performed our evaluation on as well as the used compilers and libraries. The repository is structured into three parts:

* cp2k: A submodule linking in our modified CP2K code. Note that for the hardware evaluation another commit is required that is referenced in the corresponding README.
* hardware_accel: Evaluation of GPU and FPGA acceleration from Section VI of our paper.
* software: Software evaluation from Section V of our paper.
