Evaluate sign iteration on GPUs and FPGAs:

* Settings: 
  * symmetric orthogonalization
  * H2O-dft-ls.inp: 864 water molecules (NREP=3), DZVP, total dimension=19872, mu=0.14
* Software versions:
  * CUDA 10.2
  * GCC 8.3.0
* Steps to reproduce:
  1. Build submatrix for first block-column of matrix_ssqrtinv_ks_ssqrtinv 
  2. export binary to ksmat.bin 
  3. run make_test_interface.sh to generate GPU routines for half, single and double as well as mixed half-single
  4. run job.sh on host with RTX 2080 TI
  5. run analyse.sh
