# Exploration

This subdirectory contains instructions and input data used to evaluate the heuristic discussed in section IV.C and to obtain the sizes and sparsities of submatrices shown in our paper.

It contains three subdirectories:

* dim_sparsities: Scripts and tools to evaluate the dimensions of the submatrices and block-based and element-based sparsities discussed in section V.C and shown in Figures 4 and 11.
* heuristics: Programs to evaluate the k-means-based heuristic and the METIS-based heuristic discussed in section IV.C and shown in Figure 5.
* truncation_thresholds: Scripts and input files used to obtain Figure 1.

The READMEs in the subdirectories give extensive information on the corresponding topics.
