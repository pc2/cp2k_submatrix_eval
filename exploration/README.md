# Exploration

This subdirectory contains to reproduce the heuristice in discussed in section IV.C and the sparsities shown in out paper. 

It has two subdirectories: 

* dim_sparsities: Scripts and tools to evaluate the dimensions of the submatrices and block-based and element-based sparsities discussed in section V.C and shown in Figures 4 and 11.
* heuristics: Programs to evaluate the k-means-based heuristic and the METIS-based heuristic discussed in section IV.C and shown in Figure 5.

The READMEs in the subdirectories give extensive information on the corresponding topics.
