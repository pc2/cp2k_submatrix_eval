# Dimensions and Sparsity of Submatrices

The version of CP2K to export the required data is commit 0448736ad07a8f5103531f3d4751ac53ee533978 and con be found in the repository at the top level of this archive. Please note that this version of CP2K writes out the complete block structure and all blocks of the orthogonalized Kohn-Sham matrix so that later analysis doesn't require CP2K runs but consumes a significant amount of disk space.
